3. It showed my student license is still valid till June 29th 2023.

4. With my old class, I only used PyCharm so I clicked the link under my license to download WebStorm, https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/?_ga=2.7518770.1277110741.1663245491-2056687010.1663245491&_gl=1*ngrcow*_ga*MjA1NjY4NzAxMC4xNjYzMjQ1NDkx*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTY2MzI0NTQ5MC4xLjEuMTY2MzI0NTU3OC4wLjAuMA...

5. Once clicking on the popup to download WebStorm, allow it permissions to your computer.

6. A setup process will appear with many configurable options.

7. Click on the Create Desktop Launcher for easy access on your desktop screen.

8. You can leave everything else default as that's what I did.

9. A new pop-up will appear which shows the progress bar of the program downloading onto your computer.

10. Once the progress bar is complete, you can click on the checkbox that says Run WebStorm and then press the Finish button on the pop-up.

11. The installation window will then close and WebStorm will open.

12. If not connected already, go to the settings cog on the bottom right and click the Manage License button.

13. If a License is not shown, press Activate New License and type in your license ID that is found under Licenses tab in your Jetbrains account.

14. It should now say Licensed to (your name) and when the license expires.

15. Once your license is activated, go to projects and press Get from VCS.

16. Press the GitHub button on the side and it will prompt you to connect your GitHub account.

17. It will redirect you to your JetBrains website for you to authorize GitHub use, activate it and then in the WebStorm application you should see any open directories.

18. Congratulations, you have installed WebStorm and connected your Github account. 
 

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

 -  **Branch**
    <br>A branch is a set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch is the one where all changes eventually get merged back into.
 -   **Clone**
     <br>When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
 -   **Commit**
    <br>A commit is an individual change to a file. When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.
 -   **Fetch**
    <br>When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.
 -   **GIT**
    <br>Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.
 -   **Github**
    <br>GitHub is a distributed version-control platform where users can collaborate on or adopt open source code projects, fork code, share ideas and more.
 -   **Merge**
    <br>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. 
 -   **Merge Conflict**
    <br>A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
 -   **Push**
    <br>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
 -   **Pull**
    <br>Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. 
 -   **Remote**
    <br>This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.
 -   **Repository**
    <br>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files, and stores each file's revision history.
